# WikiGaia Landing Page - Human-Centered Design

## Design Philosophy: "Like Talking to a Neighbor"

The new landing page should feel like asking for help from a trusted neighbor, not navigating a tech platform. Target users: grandparents who see Facebook ads, busy parents managing family logistics.

## Core Principles

- **Warmth over Efficiency**: Favor warmth and approachability over slick design
- **Simple Language**: Avoid tech terms, use everyday language
- **Few Choices**: Maximum 3 options visible at any time
- **Human Faces**: Real people, not illustrations
- **Immediate Clarity**: What we do in 5 seconds or less

## Page Structure

### Hero Section (Above the Fold)
**Headline**: "Get Help with Life's Little Problems"
**Subheadline**: "Join neighbors who understand exactly what you're going through"

**Visual**: Photo of diverse people (grandmother, mom with kids, working dad) sitting around a kitchen table, talking and smiling

**Primary Action**: Large, friendly button "Tell Us Your Problem" (not "Sign Up" or "Get Started")

**Social Proof**: Simple text under button: "Over 2,000 neighbors helping each other"

### Problem Examples Section
**Headline**: "Problems We Help With Every Day"

Three simple cards with photos and real examples:

1. **Family Logistics** 
   - Photo: Mom juggling calendar and kids
   - Text: "Help organizing family schedules, carpools, and activities"

2. **Daily Tasks**
   - Photo: Older person at grocery store
   - Text: "Getting help with shopping, appointments, and errands"

3. **Community Questions**
   - Photo: Neighbors chatting over fence
   - Text: "Finding reliable services, local recommendations, and advice"

### How It Works (Maximum Simplicity)
**Headline**: "It's As Simple As Asking a Friend"

Three steps with warm, human icons:

1. **Share Your Problem** - "Tell us what you need help with"
2. **Others Relate** - "Neighbors who have the same problem support you"
3. **We Help Together** - "When enough people need the same help, we create a solution"

### Trust & Safety
**Headline**: "Safe Space for Real People"

Simple assurances:
- "No selling your information"
- "Real neighbors, real names"
- "Kind community guidelines"

### Call to Action
**Button**: "Start Getting Help" (large, warm color)
**Alternative**: "See What Others Are Asking About" (smaller, secondary)

## Design Elements

### Colors
- Warm earth tones instead of tech blues
- Sage green, warm beige, soft coral
- Nothing too bright or "digital"

### Typography
- Readable, larger fonts
- Serif for headlines (more human/traditional)
- Sans-serif for body text (clear and accessible)

### Photography Style
- Real people, not stock photos
- Natural lighting, home/community settings
- Diverse ages, especially 45+
- Candid moments, not posed shots

### Layout
- Wide margins, lots of breathing room
- Single column on mobile
- Maximum 2 columns on desktop
- Clear visual hierarchy

## What to Remove from Current Page

- "Artisanal Workshop" language (too abstract)
- Technical terms like "AI", "platform", "system"
- Multiple call-to-action buttons
- Complex navigation options
- Trending/collections sections (overwhelming)
- Any mention of features or technology

## What to Emphasize

- Human connection and community
- Simplicity of getting help
- Real problems and real solutions
- Safety and trust
- No cost, no catch

## Conversion Goals

Primary: Get visitors to share their first problem
Secondary: Build email list for community updates

## Accessibility Considerations

- Large clickable areas
- High contrast text
- Simple navigation
- Screen reader friendly
- Works well on older devices/browsers

## Mobile Considerations

- Everything stackable and readable on small screens
- Large tap targets
- No horizontal scrolling
- Fast loading (consider bandwidth limitations)

## Content Tone Examples

**Current**: "Come in ogni laboratorio artigiano che si rispetti, qui si lavora insieme con semplicità, pazienza e il calore della comunità."

**New**: "We're here to help with the everyday things that stress you out. Like neighbors who actually care."

**Current**: "L'intelligenza artificiale è solo un attrezzo"

**New**: "We use helpful tools behind the scenes, but this is really about people helping people."

## Success Metrics

- Clicks on "Tell Us Your Problem" button
- Problem submission completion rate
- Return visits within one week

## Implementation Notes

- Remove all current complex sections
- Focus on single-purpose page
- A/B test with current version
- Start with mobile-first design
- Test with actual target demographic (not just tech-savvy users)
