# WikiGaiaLab Interactivity Specification

## Core Interactivity Principles

WikiGaiaLab's interactivity design follows five fundamental UX/UI principles to create an engaging, intuitive community-driven platform:

1. **Immediate Affordance Recognition** - Interactive elements are instantly recognizable through visual design language
2. **Responsive State Communication** - Interfaces provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions
3. **Spatial Continuity & Polish** - Purposeful motion design creates professional, cohesive experiences
4. **Natural Movement Patterns** - Digital interactions feel believable and intuitive
5. **Clear System Status** - Users always understand what's happening and what they can do next

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Animation Performance
- Use `transform` and `opacity` properties for optimal performance
- Implement `will-change` property on elements before animation starts
- Leverage CSS `transform3d()` for hardware acceleration
- Consider `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility compliance

### State Management
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback before server confirmation
- Graceful rollback animations for failed operations
- Persistent state across navigation to maintain user context
- Real-time synchronization with visual indicators for connected state

### Accessibility Considerations
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting
- Ensure all interactive elements have focus states with 3:1 contrast ratio
- Provide alternative navigation methods for gesture-based interactions
- Include ARIA labels for screen readers on animated state changes
